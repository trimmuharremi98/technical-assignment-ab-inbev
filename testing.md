Testing Strategy

Overview

This testing strategy ensures the reliability, scalability, and performance of the microservice by adopting a layered approach to testing. It focuses on unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, along with clearly defined coverage goals.

# Testing Layers

1. Unit Tests

    Scope: Validate core functionalities such as input validation, business logic, and data persistence.

    Tools: Jest (testing framework), @nestjs/testing (NestJS utilities).

Key Areas to Cover:

    Input Validation:
        -Validate JSON payload structure.
        -Ensure invalid data is rejected with proper error messages.

    Business Logic:
        -Test critical workflows, such as data transformations or specific algorithms.

    Data Persistence:
        -Mock the database to ensure proper query execution without affecting production data.

2. Integration Tests

    Scope: Test interactions between different components (e.g., API endpoints, service layer, database).

    Tools: Supertest (HTTP testing), @nestjs/testing.

Key Areas to Cover:
    -API endpoint functionality.
    -Authentication and authorization using JWT.
    -Data retrieval and storage workflows with database.

3. Test Coverage Goals

Unit Tests:
    - Cover 90% of critical paths, such as input validation and core business logic.
    - Ensure all service methods are tested.

Integration Tests:
    - Cover 80% of API endpoints.


# Plan for future integration

1. Performance Tests

    Scope: Validate the microservice's behavior under heavy loads and high concurrency.

    Tools: Artillery

    Key Metrics:
    - API response time under varying loads.
    - System behavior with millions of database records.
    
    Example Performance Test Plan

        Scenario: Simulate 1000 concurrent users accessing the POST /data and GET /data endpoints.

    Expected Outcome:
    - Response time < 500ms for 100% of requests.
    - No server crashes or downtime.
