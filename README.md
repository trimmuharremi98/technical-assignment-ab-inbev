# High-Level Project Overview

This project is a scalable, maintainable microservice designed to handle high-performance workloads. It leverages:

    Node.js with NestJS: For a structured, modular backend architecture.

    MongoDB: As the primary database for persistent data storage.

    Redis: For caching to enhance performance.

    Kubernetes: To orchestrate containerized deployments with robust scalability and reliability.

    Nginx: Used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

The microservice includes:

    API endpoints for CRUD operations.

    JWT-based authentication for secure access.

    Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to handle variable traffic efficiently.

# Setup and Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites

    Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

    Kubernetes Cluster: Have access to a Kubernetes cluster.

    kubectl: Install kubectl to manage Kubernetes resources.

    External MongoDB and Redis Services: Configure access to external databases.

# Steps to Setup and Deploy

1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/trimmuharremi98/technical-assignment-ab-inbev.git
    cd microservice

2. Build and Push Docker Image

    docker build -t my-docker-repo/my-app:latest .

    docker push my-docker-repo/my-app:latest

3. Apply Kubernetes Configurations

    Apply the ConfigMap for Nginx:

        - kubectl apply -f configmap.yml

    Deploy the application and Nginx and Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling:

        kubectl apply -f deployment.yml


# Key Technical Decisions
1. Technology Stack

    NestJS was chosen for its modular architecture and seamless integration with TypeScript.

    MongoDB was selected as the primary database due to its schema flexibility and horizontal scaling capabilities.

    Redis was added for caching to optimize response times for frequent read operations.

2. Deployment Strategy

    Kubernetes was preferred over Docker Compose for production due to its advanced orchestration, scalability, and monitoring features.

    Nginx was added as a load balancer for efficient traffic distribution.

3. External Database Services

    Utilizing managed MongoDB and Redis services offloads maintenance responsibilities, allowing the focus to remain on application development.


# Trade-offs

    Higher Complexity: Kubernetes and managed database services introduce additional configuration and operational overhead.

    Cost: Managed database services and cloud-based Kubernetes clusters may incur higher operational costs.

Technology trade-offs:

    MongoDB:

        Less efficient for complex transactions compared to relational databases.

        Compared to PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL handles relational and transactional data better but is harder to scale horizontally.

    Nodejs with Typescript:

        Java is better memory management and optimized for long-running processes



# Future Roadmap and Optimization Ideas

1. Monitoring and Observability

    Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of application performance.

    Use ELK Stack for centralized logging.

2. API Gateway

    Introduce an API gateway (e.g., Kong, Traefik) to manage API traffic, rate limiting, and authentication.

3. CI/CD Enhancements- Testing

    Include performance testing (Artillery or k6) in the pipeline.

6. Security Hardening

    Implement more advanced security measures, such as IP whitelisting, data encryption, and vulnerability scans.
