Architecture

# Overview of Components

    1. API Layer: Manages HTTP requests, performs input validation, and sends responses.
        1.1 Authentication: JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints.
    2. Service Layer: Contains core business logic, handles validation, and communicates with the MongoDB database.
    3. Database Layer: Stores and retrieves data, optimized for scalability and performance.
    


# Technology Choices and Justification

1. Language 

    Technology: Node.js with Typescript

Justification:

    Nodejs its fast execution and event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it ideal for handling high-concurrency, real-time applications.

    Its asynchronous nature allows it to efficiently handle thousands of simultaneous connections.

    TypeScript enhances JavaScript with static typing, improving code quality, developer productivity, and maintainability

    Node.js has a vast library ecosystem via npm, allowing developers to leverage pre-built modules for faster development.

2. Framework

    Technology: NestJS 

Justification:

    NestJS offers a modular architecture for building scalable and maintainable applications.

    Provides a modular architecture for building scalable and maintainable applications.

    Built-in support for dependency injection, making it easier to manage services and controllers.

# Layers 

1. API Layer

    Technology: REST API, NestJS with TypeScript

Justification:

    Request Handling:
        - Node.js handles asynchronous I/O efficiently, making it ideal for processing multiple concurrent API requests.
        NestJS provides a modular and structured approach with built-in routing, making it easy to define and manage endpoints.
    
    Validation:
        NestJS integrates seamlessly with libraries like class-validator and class-transformer, enabling declarative validation using decorators.
        TypeScript ensures compile-time type checks, reducing errors in request handling.

    Response Generation:
        NestJS has built-in support for interceptors and decorators to manage responses, including status codes and payload formatting.
        Its middleware architecture simplifies pre- and post-processing of requests and responses.



    1.1 Authentication (if needed)

        Technology: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

    Justification:

        Stateless Authentication:
            JWT is stateless, meaning no session information is stored on the server. The server only verifies the token, reducing the load on backend systems.
            This makes JWT particularly suitable for scalable microservices and distributed systems.

        Compact and Portable:
            JWTs are compact and easily sent over HTTP headers or cookies, making them ideal for RESTful APIs.
    
        Self-contained:
            A JWT contains all the necessary claims (e.g., user ID, roles) to verify and authorize the user without additional database queries.
            This speeds up request processing and reduces latency.


2. Service Layer

    Technology: NestJS (TypeScript)

Justification:

    Provides built-in structure for service and controller separation.

    Simplifies the implementation of business logic with decorators and dependency injection.

3. Database Layer

3.1 Technology: MongoDB

Justification:

    Document-based database that scales horizontally with sharding.
        - Sharding enables partitioning data across multiple nodes, allowing the system to scale to billions of records.

    Handles large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data.

    Better for use cases where complex queries and multi-document transactions are important.

    Supports indexing and aggregation pipelines for fast query execution.

    Flexible schema design and high performance for large datasets.

3.2 Technology: Redis (Cache Layer)

Justification:

    In-memory storage ensures sub-millisecond response times
    
    Ideal for read-heavy workloads.
    
    Offers advanced data structures (e.g., lists, sets, sorted sets) for diverse use cases.
    
    Supports clustering and replication for horizontal scaling.
